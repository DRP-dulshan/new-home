 *  DRP CAR FLEET — /ecosystem/car-fleet
 * ============================================================================
 *  An added service for DRP owners, Holiday Homes guests and clients — not a
 *  rental business. No prices, booking or dates; every route leads to the
 *  team.
 *
 *  The fleet is one model, the VGV U70 Pro. Specs are the manufacturer's UAE
 *  figures (ZigWheels UAE / CarNewsChina); confirm the seat count of DRP's own
 *  car (the U70 Pro comes as a 5- or 7-seater).
 *
 *  PHOTOS: the hero is DRP's own branded car. Every gallery photo below is a
 *  TEMPORARY manufacturer press image (public/images/car-fleet/) — replace
 *  each file with DRP's own exterior and interior shots, keeping the names,
 *  or edit the lists.
